This project is an Instagram clone created as my first major project to learn and practice full-stack development concepts. It helped me understand how to:

Make API function calls to fetch and update data dynamically.

Implement core features like user authentication, posting, liking, commenting, and following.

Structure a project using frontend and backend integration.

Work with databases, REST APIs, and state management.

This project was primarily built for learning and experimentation, helping me gain practical experience in building a real-world web application from scratch.
